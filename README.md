# The-Budget-Tool-
An app to solve financial problems


1. This should be a cross platform application
2. It should be open sourced so that anyone can contribute
3. It should be targeted towards developers because they should be able to self host this tool.
4. Feature 1 - Budget: Create Budgets & Templates for Budgets
5. Feature 2 - I/O: Basic double entry bookeeping
6. Feature 3 - Envelope System: This should allow to move money between envelopes (which function like accounts)
7. Feature 4 - Calendar: For all those subscriptions I forget
8. Feature 5 - Forecasting: Predictive analysis based on I/O Behavior 
9. Feature 6 - Integration: Connecting to other financial services such as MTN MoMo
10. Feature 7 - Export: CSV
11. Feature 8 - Reports (Mail: Notification)

It should feel like a great product. I would call it Envelope (But I am not married to it)
